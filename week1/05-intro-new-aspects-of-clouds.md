##1-5 Intro : New aspects of clouds

- On-demand access: *aas classification
  
  - pay as what you use (AWS EC2)

  - Haas(Hardware as a service): It may have some security consideration using it.

  - Iaas(Infrastructure as a service): Providing you a VM and you can login do something awesome.

  - Paas(Platform as a service): Comparing to `Iaas` You don't have authority to login the vm, but you can run your codes on cloud machine(Like google app engine). And it can autoscale your application.
  
  - Saas(Software as a service): Its definition is commonly broad, but none of above can exactly consider it as Saas. For instance: Gmail, google docs...etc.

- Data-intensive Computing

  - The focus shifts from computation to the data.

- New cloud programming paradigms

  - There are many things you can refer in the course's ptt.(Google MapReduce)

  - In conclusion those programming pradigms make you query and store data more fairly quickly than before.

  - This is just like the programming languae become more and more easier to learn.
